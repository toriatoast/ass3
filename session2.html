                    <h2><u>What is HL7? </u></h2>
                    <p>The Health Level 7 (HL7) is a set of messaging rules and guidelines developed by the Health Level Seven International not-for-profit organization [1]. 
                        The purpose of HL7 is to improve the exchange of health information by providing a standardized framework that ensures readability and seamless integration 
                        across different operating systems [2]. Consequently, the standard streamlines healthcare communication and improved patient outcomes.  
                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to note that the HL7 only provides a way to structure health messages but does not explain how it should be stored in different systems. 
                        Furthermore, there is room for messaging customization within the standard which allows for more accurate reflection of health status and information [3].  </p>
                    <p>Like other standards, the HL7 is constantly being revised and modified to more accurately reflect industry landscape and maintain relevancy. 
                        The most recent revision is HL7 V3, however as it is not backwards compatible healthcare organizations are still reluctant to apply it [3,4]. 
                        HL7 V2 is the more common version of HL7 used as it is customizable and backwards compatible. FHIR is another adaptation of the original HL7 that leverages the best 
                        features from HL7 V2 and V3 and the latest web service technology. For more information on the differences between HL7 and FHIR look to the resources below.  </p>
                    
                    <h2><u>Why is HL7 important? </u></h2>
                    <p>More often than not, patients will visit more than one physician from other organisations, and it is common for research institutes to communicate 
                        information with each of their own operating systems. To ensure efficient care, healthcare providers must have access to the EHR, and these records must be legible 
                        for multiple authorised personnel to read. HL7 overcomes this challenge by providing a standardised framework for information to be displayed, exchanged, and retrieved. 
                        It also provides guidelines to ensure seamless integration of information from different operating systems, thus improving workflow and reducing transfer issues. 
                        With access to patient EHRs, physicians can make better-informed decisions and provide improved personalised healthcare. Ensuring readability also minimises misdiagnoses. </p>
                    
                    <h2><u>How does Hl7 work? </u></h2>
                    <p>An HL7 message has the following structure key points [5]. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>HL7 messages are composed of segments and each segment consists of one more composite or fields.  </li>
                            <li>Each segment begins with a three-unit code (typically three alphas) also known as the segment ID.  </li>
                            <li>Segments are written on new line of text. </li>
                            <li>Composites are separated by pipe | and if the composite is composed of sub-composites, then they are separated by carets ^. </li>
                            <li>Composites contains the message components.  </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
