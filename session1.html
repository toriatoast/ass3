                <div class="card-body">
                    <h2><u>What is the ICD?</u></h2>
                    <p>Initially developed in response to the need for an international health database that crosses languages and borders, 
                        the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been fundamental in advancing our knowledge of human diseases and health. 
                        The ICD is a globally recognized valid way of identifying and organizing disease and health related information for clinical and preclinical purposes [1].
                        The ICD has been used in a variety of ways, namely in the accurate collection of disease data for statistical purposes to uncover the root causes of diseases 
                        and health trends [2]. Not only this, but the ICD is also used in billing payment structures, administration standards, research allocation, etc.</p>

                    <p> Perhaps the most significant contribution the ICD has made is allowing for the interoperability of international information in an easy-to-understand way. 
                        This has allowed physicians and researchers to benefit from a centralised system for optimised and standardised patient care, such as reporting on mortality. 
                        It additionally ensures that information is up-to-date and accurate. </p>
                    
                    <h2><u>How ICD-9 and ICD-10 are different?</u></h2>
                    <p>Since the development of the ICD, many revisions and modifications are constantly made to reflect the changing world of health and ensure relevancy to advancements in medicine. 
                        This is evident in the most recent (before ICD-11) version of the ICD being the 10th edition. Although similar, there are distinct differences between the 9th and 10th editions as follows [3] [4]: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>ICD-10 has three-volumes whilst ICD-9 has two volumes. </li>
                            <li>ICD-10 expanded their medical codes from approx. 17,000 to 155,000. </li>
                            <li>ICD-10 has alphanumeric categories with possible 7 digits rather than 5-unit codes.</li>
                            <li>Inclusion of ambulatory and managed care related information and revision of coding rules to injury/mortality. </li>
                            <li>Overall minor changes to categorical arrangement and grouping. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Increasing the number of codes and code capacity improves the granularity of ICD-10 allowing for increased specificity and room for additional information.  </p>

                    <h2><u>Code Structure [5]:  </u></h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Starts with alpha (not including U) </li>
                        <li>Second unit is numeric </li>
                        <li>From 3rd to 7th unit, can be either alpha or numeric </li>
                        <li>Decimal point after third unit.  </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2><u>ICD-10 Australian Modification (ICD-10 AM): </u></h2>
                    <p>ICD-10 AM is the Australian-modified version of ICD-10 to more accurately reflect the landscape of Australian healthcare. 
                        It includes additional Australian-specific disease codes and classification of procedures based on Commonwealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) [6]. 
                        The goal of this was to standardise procedure classification in the private and public sectors. An extrapolation of this is the Medicare Benefits Schedule, 
                        Extended (MBS-E), which is more specific and includes codes for procedures not covered by government benefits. </p>
